This Voting System web application built using Django can serve as the automated voting system for organizations and/or institutions. The system works like the common election manual system of voting whereas the system must be populated by the list of the positions, candidates, and voters. The E-voting system can help a certain organization or school to minimize the voting time duration because aside providing the voters an online platform to vote, the system will automatically count the votes for each candidate. The system has 2 sides of the user interface which are the administrator and voters side. The admin user is in charge to populate and manage the data of the system and the voter side which is where the voters will choose their candidate and submit their votes.
