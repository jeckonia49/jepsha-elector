    <b>What makes JpsaElector different/better than other voting systems?</b>

    <p>
      JpsaElector is truly verifiable. Each voter obtains a ballot tracker which
      can be checked against the Ballot Tracking Center to ensure that the
      ballot was received and tallied appropriately. What this means is that no
      one, not even the administrators of the JpsaElector Voting system, can
      alter your vote.

      JpsaElector?</b
    >
    <p>
      Many voting systems claim to be voter-verifiable. We believe
      voter-verifiability is critically important, and we support the efforts of
      other organizations to help improve the voting machines used in
      public-office elections. However, we believe that more extensive
      verifiability is needed, with voters able to ensure that the tallying
      process, not just the recording of their ballot, was performed correctly.
      We call that “true verifiability.” Others have called this concept
      “end-to-end verifiability” or “open-audit.”

    <b>How secret is my vote on JpsaElector?</b>
    <p>
      JpsaElector takes great care to protect the secrecy of your vote. Your
      vote is encrypted inside your browser before it is even sent to the
      server. Even on older browsers, your vote is encrypted before you log into
      JpsaElector. In all cases, your vote is stored in the database only in
      encrypted form. JpsaElector then uses advanced cryptographic techniques to
      combine all of the encrypted votes into an encrypted tally, and only the
      tally is decrypted. This means that your ballot is never individually
      decrypted. To provide for the highest level of privacy, JpsaElector lets
      election administrators designate multiple trustees. All trustees must be
      involved in decryption, which further ensures that only the tally, never
      the individual votes, are decrypted.

    <b>What's so special about the JpsaElector Ballot Tracker?</b>
    <p>
      A typical tracking number, say for shipping a package, is more or less a
      random number: it means nothing other than the label on your package. It’s
      conceivable that your package gets there, tracking number intact, but its
      contents destroyed. In the digital world, we’re able to produce a special
      kind of tracking number that is far from random: it is a fingerprint of
      the encryption of your vote. So, if your ballot tracker makes it all the
      way to the tally, you know that not only did your ballot make it into the
      tally, you also know that it wasn’t tampered with in the process.

      >Is JpsaElector the only system that provides this level of
      verifiability?</b
    >
    <p>
      Yes, at the moment in the entire <strong>JKUAT COMMUNITY</strong>. The
      JpsaElector System packs a number of innovations focused on enabling true
      verifiability for online elections to help everyone get a taste if this
      groundbreaking technology. But we are not the only game in town.
